    "\n",
    "This notebook creates a  simulation of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with a shared key between two parties (Alice and Bob). We consider the attack of a man in the middle (Eve, an eavesdropper that increases noise by adding a measure qubit or sabotages the QKD) and a parity qubit that checks if there's a third person. When the number of parity errors is greater than the threshold set by Alice and Bob, the QKD is not valid and they don't receive any key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the previous quantum circuit in blockchain. Now we have three parties (Alice, Bob and Charlie) that compete in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus. The competition works similar to rock paper scissors. A, B and C generates a one digit random number (0 or 1) and play until one of them gets a 1 and the rest a 0, so the first one wins. Each qubit is entangled to another qubit that reads the next player, i.e. A knows their results and C's, B knows the results from B and A and C knows C's and B's numbers. Then, A can certify C, B can certify A and C can certify B. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, A, B and C can cheat by modifying their maximally entangled qubit to be a pure state |1> (Cheat 1) or modifying the entangled qubit to be |0> (Cheat 2). Three parity qubits check whether someone cheated or not. There's consensus only when everyone plays fair or just one person cheats. If there is not consensus, the block is not validated and is restarted."

    "# Symmetric quantum key distribution (QKD)\n",
    "\n",
    "First we create the circuit to generate a symmetric QKD between Alice and Bob. There are three qubits: A, B and P, that is used to check parity between A and B qubits. This circuit is composed by four quantum gates. First we generate a random one-digit number (0 or 1) using a Hadamard gate on the first qubit and a CNOT gate targetting the second qubit. The man-in-the-middle sabotages or creates noise by adding a qubit to measure. This effect is modeled by a tensorial product of rotation matrices applying on each qubit with angles theta1 and theta2. When theta1 = theta2 = 0, Eve is not attacking. The parity gate sets P to 1 when there is not a parity error (A and B are equal), i.e. when there are not man-in-the-middle attacks or they are undetectable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is generated running the simulation N (number of shots) times and choosing the last num_bits (key's length) valid digits. In each shot the circuit checks if parity fails. When this happen, this shot is discarded automatically. If there are more parity fails than a security threshold set by A and B, the key is marked as invalid.\n",

Each qubit is entangled to another one that reads the next player (A reads C, B reads. The game ends when one of them gets a 1 (paper) and the others get 0 (rock).
