Mixing quantum computing with classical crypto.
### Quantum Key Distribution with Man-in-the-middle simulation
* Generating symmetric keys for classical cryptographic symmetric encryption algorithms using
a quantum computer.

### Quantum Rock Paper Consensus
* Fixing consensus algorithms delegating BFT-consensus to a quantum computers.

*Disclaimer: In depth documentation and jupyter notebook to understand the code will eventually come.
